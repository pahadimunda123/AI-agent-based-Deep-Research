# AI-agent-based-Deep-Research
AI agent-based deep research involves the use of intelligent, autonomous software agents that can perform complex tasks such as data gathering, analysis, hypothesis generation, and reasoning across vast, multidimensional datasets. These agents operate within specialized environments or systems, using advanced natural language understanding, machine learning, and reasoning algorithms to collaborate, adapt, and improve over time. In deep research contexts, such agents are often deployed to explore scientific literature, identify novel connections, and assist in solving intricate problems by simulating expert-level decision-making. Their ability to operate continuously, learn from feedback, and refine strategies makes them powerful tools for accelerating discovery in fields like drug development, climate modeling, and theoretical physics.

Design a Deep Research AI Agentic System that crawls websites using Tavily for online information gathering. Implement a dual-agent (or more agents) system with one agent focused on research and data collection, while the second agent functions as an answer drafter. The system should utilize the LangGraph & LangChain frameworks to effectively organize the gathered information.
